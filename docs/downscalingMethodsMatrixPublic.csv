(2015), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to... ERA5.
We then introduce a similar method... to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).
Together, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output... and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts."""
